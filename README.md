# Login and Registration Page with CoreData

In this basic project, which was used at the beginning of many projects, I created a user registration and login system using CoreData.

When the application opens, the following login page welcomes us.

If an e-mail address is entered without registering here, the system gives a warning.

The registration screen looks like the following. Here, e-mail and password control is done with regex. If the information is not entered as desired or not entered at all, a warning is given to the user.

When the information is entered as desired, the sign of successful registration appears and when the OK button is pressed, it is directed to the login page.

If there is an e-mail entered in the system while registering, the user is warned that there is an account with this e-mail.
